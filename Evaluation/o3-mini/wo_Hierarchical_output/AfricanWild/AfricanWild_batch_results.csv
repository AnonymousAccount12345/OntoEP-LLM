Lion,eats,some,Herbivore
Explanation:,,,
• Based on the class definition the Lion “primarily hunts and feeds on herbivorous animals,” so a minimal yet informative restriction is that there exists at least one Herbivore that a Lion eats.,,
• The “eats only Herbivore” candidate was judged too strict since the description uses “primarily” rather than “exclusively.”,,,
• The “eats some Animal” candidate is overly general given that Herbivore is a subclass of Animal and the support text focuses on herbivores.,,,
Thus, the final property restriction is that Lion eats some Herbivore.,,
