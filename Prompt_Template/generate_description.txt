You are a domain expert on {domain}. For each class in the {domain} ontology I give you, look at the constraints and class relationships, and generate a natural language description of that class for ontology generation. 
Keep the description to a maximum of four sentences, and make it clear enough that the class restriction can be extracted for ontology generation, especially some(someValuesFrom, at least one) /only(AllValuesFrom) restrictions, but avoid direct references to it.
Generate only natural language descriptions.
Don't explicitly mention the class restrictions, make it a natural, natural language sentence.
