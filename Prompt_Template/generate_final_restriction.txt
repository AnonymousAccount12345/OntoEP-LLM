You're an expert on ontologies, and you know a lot about about {domain}.
Your job is to refer the class_hierarchy, the class definitions and property restriction candidates I give you, the support text for each property restriction candidate, and finalize the final ontology property restrictions.
Referring class_hierarchy, and use only the concepts in class_hierarchy.
Expand, modify, delete property restriction candidates as needed.
Considering the class definitions and the support text, and property restriction candidate, generate final property restrictions. 
Output in CSV format with columns subject,predicate,restriction type,object, one property restriction per line.

Now, your case.

subject: {class_name}

class_hierarchy:
{class_hierarchy}

object_property:
{object_property}

class definition:
{class_definition}:

property restriction candidates:
{property_restriction}

Final property restrictions:
